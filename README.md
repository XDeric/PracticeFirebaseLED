# PracticeFirebaseLED

# Lights Through Wifi
Trying out Siri functionality\
There is Arduino Code too\

**Materials**
* Arduino Uno Wifi
* IOS Phone
* XCode
* Arduino IDE
* Firebase RTDB(Real Time Data Base)

**Inspiration**
I was facinated with what you can do with Apple's Home App. So to be understand how it works with siri I took the task to recreate a simpler version of it.

**Purpose**
Using siri to execute a function in the app that changes data on firebase which the arduino reads and then changes the output of an LED.\
So far with basic button UI controls(on/off) the LED on an arduino through wifi internet with firebase communication.
Working on creating siri intents so you won't have to open the app everytime to click the button, but command with your voice
Work in progress...
